# **Bloop - Frontend Repository**

Welcome to the frontend repository for Bloop, a unique subscription-based platform that bridges the gap between authors and readers. We offer access to various versions of books and personal mentorship sessions with authors. Engage in an immersive reading experience and dive into the world of literature like never before.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
